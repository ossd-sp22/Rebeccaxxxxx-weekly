## Group Work Reflection

This week my teammates and I met to work on our group project. <!--more--> We are trying to contribute to Zulip. I finished setting up the environment on Wednesday including Vagrant and Docker, which is a virtual machine on my computer where Zulip runs. But I was confused by why is VM necessary, which professor Klukowska explained to me in class that it is for Zulip to be able to run expectedly in its desired operating system on any computer. Tanya had some problems with running Docker on her computer, and in class, I was trying to help her figure it out. In the end, we found out it simply was not installed properly, and the problem was fixed after a few reinstalls. 

We were quite surprised that after Tanya greeted the contributors last week, over a hundred more new contributors introduced themselves in the group chat. The number of contributors working on this project is enormous. This can cause a problem where it would be difficult for our team to find issues we can work on. In fact, during class, we found a good first issue for beginners, but right after class, it was claimed by someone else. So this might be the biggest challenge we are going to face in future meetings.
