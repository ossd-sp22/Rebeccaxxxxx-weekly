## Group Work Reflection

This week my teammates and I met to work on our group project. We are trying to contribute to Zulip. Tanya had some problems with running Docker on her computer, and I was trying to help her figuring it out. At the end we found out it simply was not installed properly, and the problem was fixed after a few reinstalls. 

We were quite surprised that after Tanya greeted the contributors last week, there are over a hundred more new contributors introducing themselves in the groupchat. The number of contributors working on this project is enormous. This can cause a problem where it would be difficult for our team to find issues we can work on. In fact, during class we found a good first issue for beginners, but right after class it was claimed by someone else. So this might be the biggest challenge we are going to face in future meetings.
