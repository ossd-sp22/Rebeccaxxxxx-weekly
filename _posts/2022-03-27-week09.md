## Project Group Discussion

This week we met up with our group members for the course project and discussed which open source project we want to contribute to. <!--more--> My teammates are Tanya and Matthew. Although we haven't worked together before, I pleasantly found out that we all love front end and design, and we all work well with Javascript. We even all have taken AIT taught by Professor Versoza. We discussed our meeting time and exchanged phone numbers so we can reach out to each other more conveniently. 

Then we looked at some potential open source projects including open source video games and finally decided on contributing to Zulip. Zulip is a messaging software similar to Slack. Its interface is very neat and pretty. Its community seems nice and welcoming, and its git is quite active. There is a new member section in the chat where people introduce themselves, and Tanya introduced herself in it. However, besides all the nice things about Zulip, it is a real pain to download and set up their environment, and none of our group members have experience with it. So we're using this coming week to try setting it up first.

## Tom Callaway

Sadly I missed this course due to personal reasons.
