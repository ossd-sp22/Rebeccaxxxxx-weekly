## OSS Business Models

In this session, we talked about open source software's business models. <!--more--> One of them is Software-as-a-service(Saas). It happens that the group project my team currently is working on, Zulip, is Saas. Users can use Zulip simply by going to its website, without the need to download anything. It is an affordable open source alternative to Slack, which is also Saas but is closed source. 

I also learned about inner source for the first time in class. It is open source within the company, which I think is a very smart way to both keep the code secret from the public and to benefit from having more eyes looking at the code and fixing bugs. But I guess it will only work in large companies because small ones won't have enough people to maintain open source's quick iteration. 

## Group Work on Zulip

We made our first pull request! Even though we only made a small fix, it was a really exciting moment for us. Our group members have different strengths and we worked well together. Tanya is good at communicating and finding target files, Matthew is very good at Git commands, and I understand hbs and js code well. Together, we were able to find the issue file, add new code, and push it to GitHub smoothly. Now we are happily moving towards the next issue.
