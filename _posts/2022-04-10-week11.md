## OSS Business Models

In this session, we talked about open source software's business models. <!--more--> One of them is Software-as-a-service(Saas). It happens thhat the group project my team currently is working on: Zulip, is Saas. Users can use Zulip simply by going to its website, without the need to download anything. It is an affordable open source alternate to Slack, which is also Saas but is closed source. 

I also learned about inner source for the first time in class. It is open source within the company, which I think is a very smart way to both keep the code secret from the public and to benefit from having more eyes looking at the code and fixing bugs. But I guess it will only work in large companies because small ones won't have enough people to maintain open source's quick iteration.
